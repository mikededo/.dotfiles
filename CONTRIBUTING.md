## Contributing

Here are some guidelines to follow before contributing to the repository:

### Commit messages

This repository follows [conventional
commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Please make sure to
use the appropriate type and scope when committing your changes.

### Scopes

Scopes are mandatory, but they are preferred. Use the scopes for each stow
package. So, if you are making a change that effects the `fish` package, the
commit should include the `fish` scope.  
Changes to documentation files are exempt of using a scope.
